### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yee Kit!

I'm a junior studying Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. Iâ€™m passionate about interaction design, social computing, and software development, and Iâ€™m excited to innovate societally impactful solutions. In my free time, I love listening to music from all across the world, collecting memorabilia, and preparing surprises for friends.
